"CPAPER","A Data Integration Framework for e-Commerce Product Classification","Bergamaschi,S.;Guerra,F.;Vincini,M.",2002,"ISWC",,"paper","A marketplace is the place in which the demand and supply of buyers and vendors participating in a business process may meet. Therefore, electronic marketplaces are virtual communities in which buyers may meet proposals of several suppliers and make the best choice. In the electronic commerce world, the comparison between different products is blocked due to the lack of standards (on the contrary, the proliferation of standards) describing and classifying them. Therefore, the need for B2B and B2C marketplaces is to reclassify products and goods according to different standardization models. This paper aims to face this problem by suggesting the use of a semi-automatic methodology, supported by a tool (SI-Designer), to define the mapping among different e-commerce product classification standards. This methodology was developed for the MOMIS system within the Intelligent Integration of Information research area. We describe our extension to the methodology that makes it applyable in general to product classification standard, by selecting a fragment of ECCMA/UNSPSC and ecl@ss standard."
"CPAPER","A Formal Model for Topic Maps","Auillans,Pascal;Ossona de Mendez,Patrice;Rosenstiehl,Pierre;Vatant,Bernard",2002,"ISWC",,"paper","Topic maps have been developed in order to represent the structures of relationships between subjects, independently of resources documenting them, and to allow standard representation and interoperability of such structures. The ISO 13250 XTM specification have provided a robust syntactic XML representation allowing processing and interchange of topic maps. But topic maps have so far suffered from a lack of formal description, or conceptual model. We propose here such a model, based on the mathematical notions of hypergraph and connexity. This model addresses the critical issue of topic map organization in semantic layers, and provides ways to check semantic consistency of topic maps. Moreover, it seems generic enough to be used as a foundation for other semantic standards, like RDF."
"CPAPER","A Mini-experiment in Semantic Annotation","Schreiber,Guus;I. Blok,Inger;Carlier,Daan;P. C. van Gent,Wouter;Hokstam,Jair;Roos,Uri",2002,"ISWC",,"paper","This paper describes a mini-experiment in using a tool for semantic annotation to index photographs of Windsor chairs, a type of antique furniture. The annotation tool makes use of an ontology based on art standards. We report on the experiences of subjects using the tool. The results suggest that a certain level of domain expertise is needed for semantic annotations, but also that an annotation tool has a clear added value for indexers."
"CPAPER","An RDF NetAPI","Seaborne,Andy",2002,"ISWC",,"paper","This paper describes some initial work on a NetAPI for accessing and updating RDF data over the web. The NetAPI includes actions for conditional extraction or update of RDF data, actions for model upload and download and also the ability to enquire about the capabilities of a hosting server. An initial experimental system is described which partially implements these ideas within the Jena toolkit."
"CPAPER","Automatic Generation of Java/SQL Based Inference Engines from RDF Schema and RuleML","Eberhart,Andreas",2002,"ISWC",,"paper","This paper describes two approaches for automatically converting RDF Schema and RuleML sources into an inference engine and storage repository. Rather than using traditional inference systems, our solution bases on mainstream technologies like Java and relational database systems. While this necessarily imposes some restrictions, the ease of integration into an existing IT landscape is a major advantage. We present the conversion tools and their limitations. Furthermore, an extension to RuleML is proposed, that allows Java-enabled reaction rules, where calls to Java libraries can be performed upon a rule firing. This requires hosts to be Java-enabled when rules and code are moved across the web. However, the solution allows for great engineering flexibility."
