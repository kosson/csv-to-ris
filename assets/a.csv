On the one hand, however, these efforts are often about solutions whose sustainability and portability is limited, on the other hand, implicitly existing relationships between bibliographic and administrative information are not taken into account -- which stocks and departments, for example, are actually hidden behind ""computer science""? In the ""Web of Data"", on the other hand, a wide variety of resources from a wide variety of domains and local as well as global sources can be related to one another and linked to one another. By adhering to a few basic principles, a high degree of interoperability and reusability of the data can be achieved. With this approach, the Bochum project ""Integrated Library Portal"" wants to create an infrastructure that can be used to react as flexibly and sustainably as possible to the immediate local conditions (two-tier library system, University Alliance Metropolis Ruhr) and medium-term requirements (integration of heterogeneous primary data).

"CPAPER","Free Data - The Road to Linked Data","SWIB","paper",2009,"Danowski,Patrick","cern,bibliographic data,MARCXML,libris,swib 2009","The CERN Library is preparing the final steps to publish the complete bibliographic data on the web under a free license. Initially, these should be made available in MARC-XML. At the same time, there are various considerations as to how this data can be presented in the framework as linked data. For this, the experience of LIBRIS should be used. This approach is to be extended to other resources at the same time. There are already a few ideas that should be presented in the lecture."
"CPAPER","Integration of linked data into existing library applications","SWIB","paper",2009,"Neubert,Joachim;Borst,Timo","sparql,thesaurus,indexing,zbw,swib 2009,REST,indexing,retrieval,demo","Existing library applications - catalogues, portal systems or open access repositories - are not prepared to actually exploit the opportunities linked data offers. In order to be able to make better use of sources available on the Semantic Web, such as the standard economics thesaurus, the ZBW has therefore started to develop a lightweight application architecture. It is based on web services that query the data from Semantic Web (-SPARQL) endpoints and make it accessible via a simple, use-case-centric REST interface. This means that the data can be used directly on the websites by conventional web applications. A beta implementation of two key use cases - thesaurus support in indexing and in retrieval - is presented and it is demonstrated."
"CPAPER","Introduction to the Semantic Web","SWIB","paper",2009,"Voss,Jakob","introduction,swib 2009,semantic web,linked data,limitations","The Semantic Web as a concrete project is at least a decade old; Although it corresponds much more closely to the original vision of the web than today's World Wide Web, concrete implementation only gained momentum with Linked Data. The introduction is intended to give an insight into why and in what form the Semantic Web has become established and where its main focus and limitations lie, without going into technical details."
